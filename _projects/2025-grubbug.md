Alongside other members of the Game Development Association Team Project at Cornell, I made art for the video game *Grub Bug*. In this game, you play as a bug with a food cart, making and serving customers while dodging and evading law enforcment.

I worked as background and game asset artist. This meant I designed the background elements of the game, which involved making 3D models of the various buildings, texturing them, as well as drawing 2D sprites for the smaller assets. I also worked on extra assets, such as the level select screen, some extra UI assets, and some promotional material.

We started off with a various concept art sketches and decided on a visual style and tone for the game:

![concept art]({{ "/assets/images/gbconceptArt.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-m style="width: 100%"}
![map art]({{ "/assets/images/gblevelSelect.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-m style="width: 100%"}
![building drawings]({{ "/assets/images/gbBuildings.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-m style="width: 100%"}
![map example]({{ "/assets/images/gbSampleWorld.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-m style="width: 100%"}

The game currently has a build [on itch.io](https://dgacornell.itch.io/grubbug) and will release on Steam on May 17, 2025
