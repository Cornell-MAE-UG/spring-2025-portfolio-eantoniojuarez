While taking apart the lawnmower, we analyzed the purpose of the motor (driving the wheels + rotor blades), as well as the construction of the motor itself.

My contribution to the project consisted of:

Helping taking apart the lawnmower

Discussing the structure of the motor, and our findings in order to develop a cohesive video as a group

Analysing and presenting the function and workings of the muffler, referencing the relevant fluid dynamics models that govern the system.
