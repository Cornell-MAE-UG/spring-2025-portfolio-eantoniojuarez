For the Intro to Game Development class (CIS/INFO 3152) at Cornell, we partnered up in groups of 8 to design and create a video game that offered unique gameplay and visuals.

I worked as lead character and game asset artist. This meant I drew and animated all the characters in the game, as well as background, and extra non-UI gameplay assets.

We started off with a various concept art sketches and decided on a visual style and tone for the game:

The game can be found on the [GDIAC 2025 Showcase Website!](https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/gdiac/showcase/gallery/superfoodchain/) and will release the same day of the showcase (May 17, 2025)
